# Writing with Keywords

In many standards track documents several words are used to signify the requirements in the specification.  These words are often capitalized. 


NOTE: The force of these words is modified by the requirement level of the document in which they are used.

## MUST
This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

## MUST NOT
This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification

## SHOULD
This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

## SHOULD NOT
This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.

## MAY
This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item. An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein an implementation which does a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides.)

## Guidance in the use of these Imperatives
Imperatives of the type defined in this memo must be used with care and sparingly.  In particular, they MUST only be used where it is actually required for interoperation or to limit behavior which has potential for causing harm (e.g., limiting retransmissions)  For example, they must not be used to try to impose a particular method on implementers where the method is not required for interoperability.

## Security Considerations
These terms are frequently used to specify behavior with security implications.  The effects on security of not implementing a MUST or SHOULD, or doing something the specification says MUST NOT or SHOULD NOT be done may be very subtle. Document authors should take the time to elaborate the security implications of not following recommendations or requirements as most implementers will not have had the benefit of the experience and discussion that produced the specification.
